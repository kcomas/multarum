A scripting language written in C.

I am targeting POSIX compatibility, but have not tested on a mac.

Compile with

```c
make
```

Usage

```bash
./multarum path_to_file
```

Or to start a REPL

```bash
./multarum
```

Currently dumps all debugging output when ran, this will be removed in the future.

Examples are included in the examples folder.
